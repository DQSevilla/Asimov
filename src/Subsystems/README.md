# Subsystems
This folder contains files pertaining to subsystems on the robot
Each file should contain a class which encapsulates the components and sub-subsystems of that subsystem. These classes should also derive from the Subsystem class defined in the WPI Library. Stand by for changes to this in the future, as this base class may be changed to a class defined in dalek-manager-lib
